## COVID 19 Data Visualization Using Python (Coursera Guided Project)
This project uses a COVID-19 dataset (updated daily John Hopkins source) consisting of data related to the cumulative number of confirmed, recovered and deaths cases globally.  The dataset will be prepared in order to answer the following: How does the global spread of the virus look?  How intense has the spread of COVID-19 been in different countries?  Do COVID-19 national lockdowns and self-isolations in different countries actually impact COVID-19 transmission?  Plotly was used to plot insightful and intuitive graphs to answer the questions.  

## Project Objectives
* Understand the purpose of the project, the dataset and questions answered by the analysis.
* Use a Choropleth map to visualize the global spread of COVID-19 from the first day of the pandemic.
* Use a Bar chart to compare the massive spread of the virus in different countries. 
* Visualize the impact of the national lockdown in Italy on the spread of the virus.
* Visualize the impact of the national lockdown in Italy on the deaths rate.
